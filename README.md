# Java_Graph_Visualizer

### Overview
This project will enable users to visualize different graph based algorithms, at least that's what my end goal for this project is. It will utilize JavaFX for the visuals and the GUI. Currently, I am working on implementing a BFS visualizer where the user will be able to select a start node and a target node, and then the program will visually show how the BFS algorithm searches for the target node from the start node.

### Goals
I hope that this project will enable me to learn more about JavaFX and the different things that I can do with it. I hope to learn more about animation and front-end work, and making visually appealing simulations. I also hope that this project will be a fun way to obtain a better understanding of how graph algorithms work, such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, and many others. I hope to slowly keep adding to my project, implementing more graph algorithms, and adding more user functionality, including buttons, to make a much better simulation.

### Current Status
Currently, my project provides functionality for both BFS and DFS graph algorithms. The user is able to select a start node (green) and a target node (blue), and is able to select whether they want to visualize BFS or DFS using buttons on a secondary pop-up screen. Using the AnimationTimer class, the graph algorithms will animate how the DFS and BFS algorithms search for the target node from the start node (yellow). Upon finding the target node, the algorithm will also highlight the path it found to get from the start node to the target node (orange).
