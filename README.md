# Java_Graph_Visualizer

### Overview
This project will enable users to visualize different graph based algorithms, at least that's what my end goal for this project is. It will utilize JavaFX for the visuals and the GUI. Currently, I am working on implementing a BFS visualizer where the user will be able to select a start node and a target node, and then the program will visually show how the BFS algorithm searches for the target node from the start node.

### Goals
I hope that this project will enable me to learn more about JavaFX and the different things that I can do with it. I hope to learn more about animation and front-end work, and making visually appealing simulations. I also hope that this project will be a fun way to obtain a better understanding of how graph algorithms work, such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, and many others. I hope to slowly keep adding to my project, implementing more graph algorithms, and adding more user functionality, including buttons, to make a much better simulation.
